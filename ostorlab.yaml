  _The Asteroid Agent is a powerful scanner specializing in the detection of vulnerabilities that could be exploited remotely._
  
  ---
  
  ## Getting Started
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command:
  ```shell
  oxo scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/asteroid ip 8.8.8.8
  ``` 
  
  This command will download and install `agent/ostorlab/asteroid` and target the ip `8.8.8.8`.
  For more information, please refer to the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)
  
  
  ## Usage
  
  Agent Asteroid can be installed directly from the oxo agent store or built from this repository.
  
   ### Install directly from oxo agent store
  
   ```shell
   oxo agent install agent/ostorlab/asteroid
   ```
  
  You can then run the agent with the following command:
  ```shell
  oxo scan run --agent agent/ostorlab/asteroid ip 8.8.8.8
  ```
  
  
  ### Build directly from the repository
  
   1. To build the asteroid agent you need to have [oxo](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine. If you have already installed oxo, you can skip this step.
  
  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```
  
   2. Clone this repository.
  
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_asteroid.git && cd agent_asteroid
  ```
  
   3. Build the agent image using oxo cli.
  
   ```shell
   oxo agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
   ```
  
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.
  
   4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
       * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      oxo scan run --agent agent//asteroid ip 8.8.8.8
      ```
       * If you specified an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      oxo scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/asteroid ip 8.8.8.8
      ```
